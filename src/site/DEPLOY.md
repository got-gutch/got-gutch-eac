To handle such scenarios where changes to the infrastructure (like changing the VPC CIDR block) could potentially destroy user data, you can follow these steps:

1. **Plan and Review**: Always use `terraform plan` to review the changes before applying them. This helps in understanding the impact of the changes.

2. **State Management**: Ensure that your Terraform state is properly managed and backed up. Use a remote backend like AWS S3 with state locking using DynamoDB.

3. **Data Backup**: Before making any changes that could affect user data, ensure that you have a backup of the data. This can be done using database snapshots, file backups, etc.

4. **Blue-Green Deployment**: Use a blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime and ensure that the new version of the infrastructure is working correctly before switching over.

5. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to control the rollout of new features or infrastructure changes. This allows you to enable or disable features without redeploying the entire infrastructure.

Here is an example of how you can use Terraform to implement a blue-green deployment strategy:

```hcl
# Define two VPCs for blue-green deployment
resource "aws_vpc" "blue" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "blue-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_vpc" "green" {
  cidr_block = "10.1.0.0/16"
  tags = {
    Name = "green-vpc"
  }
}

# Define a variable to switch between blue and green
variable "active_vpc" {
  description = "The active VPC (blue or green)"
  type        = string
  default     = "blue"
}

# Use the active VPC
resource "aws_instance" "workbench" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = var.active_vpc == "blue" ? aws_vpc.blue.id : aws_vpc.green.id

  tags = {
    Name = "workbench-instance"
  }
}
```

# Solution Capability : Workbench Blue/Green Deployment

## Overview
The Workbench Blue/Green Deployment solution provides a way to deploy infrastructure changes without causing downtime or 
data loss. By using a blue-green deployment strategy, you can switch between two identical environments (blue and green) 
to minimize the impact of changes on users.

## Additional Benefits

- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce the risk of downtime and data loss by switching between blue and green environments.
- **Testing**: Test new infrastructure changes in a safe environment before switching over to the active environment.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the infrastructure by adding more resources to the blue or green environment.
- **Automation**: Automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines and Terraform scripts.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency and availability during blue/green transitions.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices for infrastructure resources to protect against threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Methods for saving and restoring user data will allow for more flexibility in managing the infrastructure.
- **Resilience**: Implementing backup and restore procedures will increase the resilience of the infrastructure.

## Features

In this example, you have two workspaces (blue and green) and a variable to switch between them. 
You can deploy the new version of the infrastructure to the green workspace, test it, and then switch the active workspace to 
green once you are confident that it is working correctly. This minimizes the risk of data loss and downtime.

### Single Pipeline Deployment Execution
- **Description**: Automate the deployment process using a single CI/CD pipeline.
- **User Stories**:
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or AWS CodePipeline.
    - Integrate all manual tasks into the pipeline:
        - Unit test executions captured for individual components and can be pulled during RCA processing
        - Release notes / Test plan created from artifacts created in Rally
        - Additional integration with ServiceNow for change ticket creation
        - Automatic client configuration validation
    - Blue-green deployment switching.

### SageMaker AI Deployment Management (Workbench)
- **Description**: Manage the deployment and configuration of Amazon SageMaker resources, ensuring user data in EFS and EBS volumes is retained during deployments.
- **User Stories**:
    - Destroying the SagaMaker domain without losing user data
    - Implement procedures to retain user data in EFS and EBS volumes during deployments.
    - Ensure a smooth transition between blue and green environments.

### S3 Deployment Management (Workbench / Portal)
- **Description**: Manage the deployment and configuration of Amazon S3 buckets and related resources, ensuring project-level S3 resources are retained and support new versions of workbench.
- **User Stories**:
    - Ensure data consistency and availability during blue/green transitions.
    - Ensure project-level S3 resources are retained and support new versions of workbench.

### Portal Integration Management
- **Description**: Manage the integration with the portal, ensuring support for the blue/green deployment model.
- **User Stories**:
    - Ensure seamless switching between blue and green environments.
    - Simplify the configuration information provided by the portal.
    - Eliminate the need for the portal to create Terraform scripts.
